OpenFL Project Creator
====================

Simple GUI for OpenFL samples

You can use it to view OpenFL samples and learn OpenFL

You can create sample projects and they should open in FlashDevelop automatically(Windows only).

You can watch it in action in this video:

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Maybe this is gonna be part of future Haxe/OpenFL IDE.
